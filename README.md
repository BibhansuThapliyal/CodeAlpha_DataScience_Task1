ðŸ“Š Dataset
Based on the Kaggle Titanic dataset, with columns such as:

Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked, etc.

Target: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

ðŸ“Œ Process
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis

Model Training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)

Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, F1-Score)

ðŸš€ Output
Predict survival based on input features.
